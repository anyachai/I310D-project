Analyzing GSS Data

This project is meant to explore a few characteristics of the American population using the 2018 GSS data. Variables of interest include: Religion that respondent was raised in, general happiness level, subjective class identification, and divorce.
The GSS data is free and availabe for public download, and my data is published under the MIT license.
The data used in this project is all qualitative data. Some are nominal (religion, class, divorce) and general happiness level is ordinal.
Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection
The GSS data can be affected by nonresponse bias as well as response bias, due to the 'survey' nature of how the GSS data was collected.
